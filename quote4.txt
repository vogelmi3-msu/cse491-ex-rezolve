Well, spring sprang. We've had our state of grace and our little gift of
sanctioned madness, courtesy of Mother Nature. Thanks, Gaia. Much obliged. I
guess it's time to get back to that daily routine of living we like to call
normal.
Never let the fear of failure be an excuse for not trying. Society tells us
that to fail is the most terrible thing in the world, but I know it isn't.
Failure is part of what makes us human.
